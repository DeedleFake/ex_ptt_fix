ex_ptt_fix
==========

An experimental rewrite of [ptt-fix](https://github.com/DeedleFake/ptt-fix) using Elixir. This is not intended for actual use. ptt-fix works just fine and an Elixir version has a lot of issues, such as more potentially complicated permission problems and higher memory usage for no real gain. It's just for fun.
